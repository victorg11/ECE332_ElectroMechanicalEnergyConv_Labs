# ECE332_ElectroMechanicalEnergyConv_Labs
Welcome to my reposity for ECE 332; lab for Electromechanical Energy Conversion (ECE 331) at Oregon State University. SW design in this course was completed using Matlab Simulink and compiled for dSpace, an engineering tool used to test mechanic systems.

## Lab Descriptions
* Lab 1: Motor's speed in respect to voltage.
* Lab 2: Implemented H-bridge using PWM.
* Lab 3: Read encoder data, and implemented a closed-loop system for self-correction.
* Lab 4: Variable Frequenct Drive (VFD) implemented with three-phase active bridges on a three-phase squirrel-cage induction machine.
* Lab 5: Closed-loop VFD on an induction motor.
* Lab 6: Implemented a Proportional, Integral, Derivative (PID) block to decrease ripple and overshoot values. I performed calculations to determine first-order and second-order transfer functions for tunning. 
* Lab 7: Converted lab 6 into a closed-loop system.
